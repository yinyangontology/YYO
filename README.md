YYO: Yin-Yang Ontology

The Yin-Yang Ontology is developed to ontologize the Yin-Yang philosophy originated in China. 

Yin and yang are Chinese philosophical concepts referring to two opposite but interconnected forces. Yin is the receptive force, and Yang the active force. The Yin-Yang concepts are the most fundamental concepts in Chinese philosophy. The concepts have been used in various applications, including traditional Chinese Medicine. It is challenging to modernize the traditional philosophical concepts. Here the goal of the YYO is to use the formal ontological way to semantically represent the Yin and Yang and their associated concepts.   

The development of YYO was initiated by Dr. Yongqun "Oliver" He during his sabbatical (November 2017 to January 2018) in Monash University, Australia.
