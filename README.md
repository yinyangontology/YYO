YYO: Yin-Yang Ontology

The Yin-Yang Ontology (YYO) is developed to ontologize the Yin-Yang philosophy originated in China. 

Yin and yang are Chinese philosophical concepts referring to two opposite but interconnected forces. Yin is the receptive force, and Yang the active force. The Yin-Yang concepts are the most fundamental concepts in Chinese philosophy. The concepts have been used in various applications, including traditional Chinese Medicine. It is challenging to modernize the traditional philosophical concepts. Here the goal of the YYO is to use the formal ontological way to semantically represent the Yin and Yang and their associated concepts.   

Thd development of the YYO has taken a long time of incubation and thinking. Dr. Yongqun "Oliver" (何勇群) He initiated the development of the YYO during his sabbatical (November 2017 to January 2018) in Monash University, Australia. He later presented a preliminary version of the Yin-Yang ontological modeling at the 14th Annual Meeting of the Information Branch of the Professional Committee of the China Association of Integrative Medicine, held in Jining, Shandong Province, from October 12th to 15th, 2023. 

Oliver presented an oral presentation titled "Logic-based Yin-Yang Ontology: Top-level Design for Integrating Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine" on November 9, 2025, in [ICBO 2025](https://icbo-conference.github.io/icbo2025/program/) - the 16th International Conference on Biological and Biomedical Ontology.
