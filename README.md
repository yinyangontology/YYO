YYO: Yin-Yang Ontology

The Yin-Yang Ontology is developed to ontologize the Yin-Yang philosophy originated in China. 

Yin and yang are Chinese philosophical concepts referring to two opposite but interconnected forces. Yin is the receptive force or principle. Yang the active force or principle. 

YYO was initiated by Dr. Yongqun "Oliver" He during his sabbatical in Monash University, Australia, in the fall 2017.
